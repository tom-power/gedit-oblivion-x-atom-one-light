# Gedit Oblivion x Atom One Light

Code dark syntax theme based on the [Gedit Oblivion theme](https://github.com/mig/gedit-themes/blob/master/oblivion.xml), with a light UI based on [Atom One Light](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui).

The panel and settings pages are inheriting general editor colours so are dark, which think it's ok but any thoughts/ideas welcome, otherwise maybe possible with features suggested in [#25986](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/25986).
