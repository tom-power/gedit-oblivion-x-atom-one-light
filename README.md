# Gedit Oblivion x Atom One Light

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) dark syntax theme based on the [Gedit Oblivion theme](https://github.com/mig/gedit-themes/blob/master/oblivion.xml), with a light UI based on [Atom One Light UI theme](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui).

![demo](https://github.com/tom-power/gedit-oblivion-x-atom-one-light/blob/main/assets/sample.png)

> **Note**  
> Used dark colors for the panel and settings, as unable find settings that would add a light UI there, also used a mid color for `icon.foreground` as it's not overridden by list settings etc, and needed to look ok in different part of the UI.
> 
> Any thoughts/ideas on how to improve welcome, maybe separate UI/editor theming will be supported in the [future](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/25986) and this will be easier.
